🤖 This repo contains different samples from AI, LLMs, and computer vision running in real time on Stream's low-latency [Video API.](https://getstream.io/video/) 

## Stream Video
Stream Video is a low-latency WebRTC API running on the [edge](https://getstream.io/blog/announcing-stream-video/), built and maintained by Stream. It serves traditional conferencing use cases, low-latency [livestreaming](https://getstream.io/video/livestreaming/) (with HLS and RTMP), and conversational voice/video agents. Developers can build with either Node.js or Python on the backend, while frontend developers can easily integrate with a few lines of code across [Android](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/android/), [iOS](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/ios/), [Flutter](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/flutter/), [React Native](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/react-native/), [React](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/react/), [JavaScript](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/javascript/) and [Unity](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/unity/) using our pre-built UI libraries.

## 📱 Examples
| **🔮** Official Samples |  |
| --- | --- |
| Mini-golf coaching assistant 
[live_sports_coach](https://github.com/GetStream/video-ai-samples/tree/live-sports-coach/live_sports_coach) is a real-time video AI example using Google’s Gemini Live to analyse players posture and putting skills. The example can be run in both a real-time mode using a device camera to view and analyse posture or it can be ran with a pre-recorded example file which is great for debugging and tweaking the model  configuration.  |  |
