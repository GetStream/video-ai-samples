## Stream Video
Stream Video is a low-latency WebRTC API running on the [edge](https://getstream.io/blog/announcing-stream-video/). It serves traditional conferencing use cases, low-latency [livestreaming](https://getstream.io/video/livestreaming/) (with HLS and RTMP), and conversational voice/video agents. Developers can build with either Node.js or Python on the backend, while frontend developers can easily integrate with a few lines of code across [Android](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/android/), [iOS](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/ios/), [Flutter](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/flutter/), [React Native](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/react-native/), [React](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/react/), [JavaScript](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/javascript/) and [Unity](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/unity/) using our pre-built UI libraries.
